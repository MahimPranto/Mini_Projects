*Created two functions-> setDate() and setTime() to extract date and time from Date();

*Stored values in different variables using getDay(),getDate(),getMonth,gerFullYear()
*getDay() gives us a numerical number, so I predeclared an array of days to get the day using the number.

*using querySelector, showed the date in the html file, where I predeclared a class "showDate" to display the date

*Similarly, stored values for time in different variable, using getHours(),getMinutes(),getSeconds().
*However, we get the time in 24hours format, so I converted it in 12-hours format by hour = hour % 12 || 12;
    Here, if the time is 24hours or 12 hours, it will show 12, and if the time is, for example, 15hours, it will show 15%12=3

Also, for better presentation, I applied the condition "< 10 ?" to add a '0' if the hour,minute or second is in single digit.

using querySelector, showed the time in the html file, where I predeclared a class "showTime" to display the time

At the end, used setInterval(setTime, 1000); to trigger the setTime function and set a an interval to update the time every second.
